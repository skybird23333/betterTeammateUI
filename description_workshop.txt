Displays health, respawn timer, and whether or not each player has potion sickness on the left of your screen. Useful for boss fights with multiple players.

(Optional: Can enable displaying what the player is holding.)

[h1]AI Warning[/h1]
I don't actually know C# and probably only wrote like 2% and I haven't bothered cleaning up.
